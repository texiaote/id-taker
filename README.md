# id-taker
an fast global id distributor written by Rust
## Overview
`id-taker` is a distributed ID generator based on the Meituan Leaf algorithm. It is designed to provide unique, sequential IDs across a distributed system, ensuring high availability and low latency.

## Features
* **Distributed**: `id-taker` is designed to work in a distributed environment, making it ideal for microservice architectures.
* **High Performance**: With its efficient algorithm, `id-taker` can generate IDs quickly, ensuring low latency.
* **Sequential IDs**: The IDs generated by `id-taker` are sequential, which is useful for sorting and other operations.

## Usage
To use `id-taker`, you need to first set up a MySQL database and configure the connection in the `config` file. Once the database is set up, you can start generating IDs by calling the `get_id` function with a business tag as the argument.

Here is an example:
```rust
let id_generator = IdGenerator::new(pool.clone());
let id = id_generator.get_id("your_biz_tag").await?;
println!("Generated ID: {}", id);
```
In this example, `"your_biz_tag"` is the business tag. You can replace it with your own business tag.

## Conclusion
`id-taker` is a powerful tool for generating unique, sequential IDs in a distributed system. Its high performance and ease of use make it an excellent choice for any application that requires unique identifiers.
